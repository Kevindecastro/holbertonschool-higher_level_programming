# Python - Everything is Object

This project explores Python's object model, focusing on:
- Object identity and type
- Mutable vs immutable objects
- Variable assignment and aliasing
- Parameter passing in functions

## Key Concepts

### Objects
In Python, everything is an object with:
- Unique identifier (memory address)
- Type
- Value

### Identity and Type
Use `id()` to get object's identifier and `type()` for its type.

### Mutability
- **Immutable**: int, float, bool, str, tuple
- **Mutable**: list, dict, set

### Variable Assignment
Assignment creates references to objects, not copies.

## How to Use
Each task file answers a specific question about Python's object model. The answers demonstrate understanding of:
- Object identity
- Variable references
- Mutability concepts

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.5
- pycodestyle 2.7.*
